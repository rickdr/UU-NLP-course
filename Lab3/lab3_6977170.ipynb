When we additionally assign probabilities to the rules of the CFG we get a PCFG: a _Probabilistic_ CFG. \n","\n","Given a sufficiently expressive PCFG (one that holds enough rules) we can parse new sentences using the Cocke–Kasami–Younger (CKY) algorithm. You can use this algorithm in three ways: to find the set of all the possible parses $p$ of a sentence $s$ under a PCFG $G$; to find the probability of the sentence by summing up the probabilities of these parses; or to find the parse $p^{*}$ of the highest probability.\n","\n","\n","### Tasks\n","1. In this notebook you will learn how to represent a PCFG in an object-oriented manner as a collection of python classes. These classes are already defined for you. Read them through thoroughly and make sure that you understand them well. You have to use them in task 2.\n","\n","2. Implement the CKY algorithm to find the most probable parse $p^{*}$ for a sentence. Your implementation will follow the psuedo-code that is given in both the lecture slides, and Jurafsky and Martin.\n","\n","The reference for this notebook is chapters 13 and 14 of [Jurafsky and Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) (both in the 2nd and 3rd edition) and the slides from week 3.\n","\n","\n","------\n","\n","### Rules\n","* The lab exercises should be made in **groups of two people**.\n","\n","* The assignment should submitted to **Blackboard** as `.ipynb`. Only **one submission per group**. See Blackboard for date of submission. \n","\n","* The **filename** should be `lab2_id1_id2.ipynb`.\n","\n","* The notebook is graded on a scale of **0-100**. The number of points for each question is indicated in parantheses. \n","\n","\n","Notes on implementation:\n","\n","* You should **write your code and answers in this iPython Notebook** (see http://ipython.org/notebook.html for reference material). If you have problems, please contact your teaching assistant.\n","\n","* Use only **one cell for code** and **one cell for markdown** answers!    \n","\n","    * Put all code in the cell with the `# YOUR CODE HERE` comment.\n","    \n","    * For theoretical questions, put your solution in the YOUR ANSWER HERE cell.\n","    \n","* Test your code and **make sure we can run your notebook**\n","\n","* For some sections in this notebook, you will need to have the Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)) installed. We will use a feature of the NLTK toolkit that lets you draw constituency parses.
